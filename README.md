# Dasmotos-Arts-And-Crafts-.
This is a HTML and CSS project I created via Codecademy.
In this project I had to create a fictional arts and crafts website externally, only using the tools I have on my computer.
##Steps
I had to: 
+ Create a folder structure for my project
+ Create a HTML file to store the structure of my website
+ Create a CSS file to store the design for my website

Feel free to look at my code, this was a very exciting project to complete and I know it will help me in the long run.
